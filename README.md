Temp Data and R Scripts

These scripts were used to produce all the statistics and figures from the O. lurida 2014 survey paper. 

**To use these scripts:**

1. Download the entire repository to your local drive. 
2. Open scripts with R Studio
3. Double check the working drive and file pathways for anything imported by the script.
4. Load required packages first, packages needed to perform each script are included at the top of the page.
5. If packages do not load use the commented install functions. Remove the hash (#) mark from the install function and run   only once.
6. Highlight the scripts and run script. If everything works right you should create the graphs and tables of data/stats.
7. 

**Note**

Percent Brooding Script is quite complicated and not easily edited. The script does not allow for the second Y axis to be labelled which is done manually.
